# Predicting-Vehicle-CO2-Emissions

This project aims to predict CO2 emissions of vehicles based on their engine sizes using simple linear regression. The dataset used for this project contains information about the engine sizes and corresponding CO2 emissions of various vehicles.

## Overview

In this project, we:

1. **Data Preparation**: We split the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. This ensures that our model is evaluated on data it has not seen during training, providing a more accurate assessment of its performance.

2. **Model Training**: We train a simple linear regression model using the training dataset. The model learns the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions to make predictions.

3. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of the trained model using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting CO2 emissions.

## Technologies used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
